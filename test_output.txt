Thought: I need to write a poem, but I should first think about the topic and the tone of the poem.
Response: "The world is vast and wide
Yet you're the one who shines so bright.
With your smile so warm and wide,
You light up the darkest of night.

Like a flower that blooms in spring,
You bring joy to all surrounding.
In your presence, all hearts sing,
You make life so much astounding.

So here's a poem I write for you,
To let you know how much you mean.
In moments when you feel blue,
Remember, you're a beauty unforeseen."

prompt: Can you write me a poem?, output: MessageNode: (getitem:21, dtype=<class 'NoneType'>, data=None), feedback: MessageNode: (getitem:22, dtype=<class 'str'>, data=Well done! You've successfully created a poem that fits the assignment description. The poem you've generated is accurate.)
Prompt
 
You're tasked to solve a coding/algorithm problem. You will see the instruction, the code, the documentation of each function used in the code, and the feedback about the execution result.

Specifically, a problem will be composed of the following parts:
- #Instruction: the instruction which describes the things you need to do or the question you should answer.
- #Code: the code defined in the problem.
- #Documentation: the documentation of each function used in #Code. The explanation might be incomplete and just contain high-level description. You can use the values in #Others to help infer how those functions work.
- #Variables: the input variables that you can change.
- #Constraints: the constraints or descriptions of the variables in #Variables.
- #Inputs: the values of other inputs to the code, which are not changeable.
- #Others: the intermediate values created through the code execution.
- #Outputs: the result of the code output.
- #Feedback: the feedback about the code's execution result.

In #Variables, #Inputs, #Outputs, and #Others, the format is:

<data_type> <variable_name> = <value>

If <type> is (code), it means <value> is the source code of a python code, which may include docstring and definitions.

Output_format: Your output should be in the following json format, satisfying the json syntax:

{{
"reasoning": <Your reasoning>,
"answer": <Your answer>,
"suggestion": {{
    <variable_1>: <suggested_value_1>,
    <variable_2>: <suggested_value_2>,
}}
}}

You should write down your thought process in "reasoning". If #Instruction asks for an answer, write it down in "answer". If you need to suggest a change in the values of #Variables, write down the suggested values in "suggestion". Remember you can change only the values in #Variables, not others. When <type> of a variable is (code), you should write the new definition in the format of python code without syntax errors, and you should not change the function name or the function signature.

If no changes or answer are needed, just output TERMINATE.

Now you see problem instance:

================================

#Instruction

                        You are a helpful assistant that wants to come up with instructions to a student to help
                        them write a poem that is satisfactory to a teacher's assignment.
                        The student's poem needs to satisfy the requirement of this assignment. 
                      You need to change the <value> of the variables in #Variables to improve the output in accordance to #Feedback.

#Code


#Documentation

(str) str0=Can you write me a poem?

Your response:

LLM response:
 {"reasoning": "The string variable str0 contains a question, 'Can you write me a poem?'. Considering the feedback and the instruction, it seems the assistant is expected to actually produce a poem instead of asking a question. The required change would be to replace the question with an actual poem. Given this is a very open-ended prompt with no specific details on the type of poem (like a Haiku, Sonnet, etc), topic or length; a generic short poem can be produced.", 
"answer": "",
"suggestion": {
    "str0": "Roses are red, \nViolets are blue, \nSugar is sweet, \nAnd so are you."
}}
SUCCESS!

Final prompt: Roses are red, 
Violets are blue, 
Sugar is sweet, 
And so are you.
