      "\"reasoning\": \"The instruction is to optimize the green light durations (East-West and North-South) to minimize the OVERALL SCORE, which represents the efficiency of traffic flow through the intersection. The initial values for East-West (EW) and North-South (NS) green light durations are both set to 15. Given the outputs, particularly the OVERALL SCORE of 75.57083282443965, there's room for improvement to find a more balanced configuration that minimizes delays and thus improves the intersection's score. Adjustments to these durations should consider the trade-off between minimizing waiting times for one direction without disproportionately increasing them for the other direction. The feedback implies that the current settings are not optimal. To optimize, we must alter the durations within the constraints of 15 to 90 seconds. Analyzing the output, we notice high 'Time lost per vehicle' for East-West movements compared to North-South, which suggests a potential imbalance in green light durations favoring one set of movements over the other. To improve, we might slightly increase the duration for East-West movement (int4) and decrease the duration for North-South movement (int5), aiming for a more balanced traffic flow that could lead to a reduced OVERALL SCORE.\",\n",

The goal is to balance the green light durations to prevent vehicle queues and delays in either direction. The feedback indicates that the provided NS green time of 10 is causing an 'NS_time out of bounds' exception, suggesting it does not meet the simulation's constraints for valid green light durations. Given the constraint that both int4 (EW_green_time) and int5 (NS_green_time) must be within the range of 15 to 90, an NS green time of 10 does not satisfy these conditions. Therefore, to solve the problem, we need to adjust int5 (NS_green_time) to be within the specified boundaries.

From the feedback, an overall score of 85.8145253129838 suggests there is room for improvement. The given durations for both directions are equal at 25. Given the instructions, this implies that neither direction is currently optimized. To improve the overall score, one needs to find a balance where the duration of green lights for each direction minimizes the average delay for all vehicles. Looking at the feedback and output, it seems like the 'Time lost per vehicle' is high for certain directions, especially from East to West and vice versa, suggesting a need to possibly redistribute the green light duration between the two directions. Adjusting these durations while staying within the constraints ([15, 90] for both int4 and int5) could help achieve a lower overall score. The specific values to choose for int4 and int5 depend on a combination of the analysis provided in the output and logical deduction on how changes to these values influence delay times and overall scores. Without precise simulation results accessible, a balanced yet somewhat experimental approach would suggest slightly adjusting these values to either increase or decrease and observing the impact on the overall score.\",\n",

Thus, adjustments need to be made to either increase or decrease the green light durations for both directions without exceeding the constraints of [15,90] for both variables. Considering that both values are relatively close to the middle of their constraints, slight adjustments in both timings can be experimented with to reach a better balance and potentially reduce the overall score. It might be beneficial to slightly increase the duration for the North-South direction (int5) as this could balance the wait times between the two directions more effectively.

The goal is to minimize the OVERALL SCORE which is influenced by the green light durations for East-West (EW_time) and North-South (NS_time) directions. The current values for int4 (East-West duration) is 33 and int5 (North-South duration) is 27. To optimize the intersection, looking at how these durations affect the overall score, adjustments to these durations are essential to find a better balance that results in minimizing the average delay and thus lowering the overall score. Given the feedback and the current setting, it is suggested to adjust the green light durations slightly to test if a better balance can be achieved. Since the documentation does not specify the impact of increasing or decreasing these values explicitly, empirical adjustments based on the feedback are necessary. Adjusting the durations closer to a balanced middle point within the allowed range might distribute the traffic flow more evenly across directions, potentially leading to a lower overall score. Hence, a slight decrease in East-West duration and an increment in North-South duration is proposed to see if it positively affects the overall score.\",\n",

Adjusting the green light durations slightly up or down from their current values might help find a better balance between the directions. Given the constraints for int4 and int5 are between 15 and 90 seconds, there's room for adjustment. We should consider the time lost per vehicle for different routes. It seems that there's significant time lost, especially for vehicles moving from E1 to W1 (98.60504201680672 seconds lost per vehicle), indicating potential room for improvement in the green light duration balance. Finding a better balance might involve increasing the duration for one direction slightly while decreasing for the other, or adjusting both in a way that vehicles in all directions experience less delay.

The current OVERALL SCORE of 87.72815097810462 suggests that there is an imbalance in the green light durations for the two directions, causing either excessive waiting times or underutilization of one direction. Adjusting these durations can better balance traffic flow, reduce vehicle delays, and thus lower the OVERALL SCORE. Given the feedback and the constraints for int4 and int5, which are between 15 and 90 seconds, the goal is to experiment with different durations within these ranges to find a more balanced setting that minimizes traffic congestion and delay. Based on the outputs, there seems to be significant delays for certain directions, most notably from E1 to W1 which indicates that the East-West duration might be too short, preventing adequate clearance of eastbound traffic. Hence, attempts to adjust the variables should consider balancing the reduction of high time lost per vehicle in directions with heavy traffic, while also mitigating increased times for less congested routes. To improve the OVERALL SCORE, an equal or slightly higher duration allocation might be experimented for the East-West direction (int4) while finely adjusting the North-South direction (int5) to achieve a better overall traffic flow.\",\n",

Since directions involving East to West and North to South show high delays, it might be beneficial to slightly adjust the green light duration to accommodate traffic demand more evenly without excessively favoring one direction over the other.

The 'Time lost per vehicle' values suggest that the East-West trips (both from W1->E1 and E1->W1) experience higher delays compared to North-South trips. This may imply that reducing the EW_time slightly and increasing NS_time might help balance the delays and potentially reduce the OVERALL SCORE. Therefore, adjusting EW_time to a slightly lower value to decrease the time lost for vehicles traveling East-West, and increasing NS_time to a slightly higher value to maintain or slightly increase the flow for North-South traffic without causing excessive waiting times, could bring a more balanced outcome.\",\n",
