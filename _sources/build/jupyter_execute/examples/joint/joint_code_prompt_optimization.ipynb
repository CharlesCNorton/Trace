    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use the `trace` package to optimize prompts and code for natural language processing tasks using the BigBench-Hard benchmark. SotA approaches on this benchmark only optimize prompts, while relying on hand-written code to extract answers from LLM responses. By leveraging the LLM-based optimizers provided in `trace`, we aim to enhance the performance of a workflow calling LLMs and post-processing their responses in generating accurate and relevant answers.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll import the necessary packages and set up our environment. We will use a copy of the BigBench-Hard benchmark hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maveriq/bigbenchhard). To use HuggingFace datasets, ensure that you have the `datasets` package installed:\n",

Looking at the existing code and templates, the issue likely originates from the prompt formatting and instructions given to the LLM for generating an answer. Currently, the prompt given to the LLM consists of an empty template formatted to include the 'str0' question. However, it is evident that the formatting and guidance within the prompt template are insufficient or incorrectly guiding the LLM to deliver the desired answer ('no'). Modifying the prompt template (str1) to explicitly guide the model on assessing the plausibility factually rather than inferring general plausibility based on context will likely yield better results. Adjusting the prompt to explicitly guide towards a factual assessment of plausibility promotes a straightforward analysis by the LLM, hence increasing the likelihood of receiving the correct answer.\",\n",

The eval function is attempting to execute the function create_prompt using syntax where `self`, `prompt_template`, and `question` are named explicitly in the eval call with the `__code` parameter, which seems to be incorrect or not supported in the current context. From the documentation and the error output, it appears that kwargs like `self=ModelWrapper0` or `prompt_template=str1` are causing the function to not recognize or improperly handle the 'question' key passed to the create_prompt function. This misconfiguration in the eval function leads to failure in string formatting, as the key 'question' does not exist in the function's execution context leading to the KeyError.

Looking at the current setup: \\n\\n1. The `str1` variable is used to create a structured prompt that includes instructions for fact-checking and preciseness, and then formulating a question-answer format. The current format in `str1` inherently encourages a detailed response because it explicitly asks for a validation of information's preciseness, which might have influenced the detailed explanation from the LLM.\\n\\n2. The `__code1` function formats the prompt to include this question, correctly formatted per `str1`. Given this setup, a straightforward 'yes' or 'no' response might be impossible to achieve unless the initial prompt (defined in `str1`) is altered to specifically ask for such a response. Therefore, modifying `str1` to a simpler question format and explicitly requesting a binary (yes/no) answer should guide the LLM better.\\n\\n3.

The error must then be happening after this point, which would involve the response being generated and then parsed.\\n\\nLooking at the __code0 function for 'extract_answer', the function attempts to split the response on 'Answer:' and take the second element from this split operation. The error comes from the fact that the response returned, 'No.', does't contain the word 'Answer:' leading to the split result being a list of length 1 and subsequently accessing the second element [1] is causing the IndexError.\\n\\nConsidering this, the proper rectification would involve adjusting the output expectation within the LLM responses to match the format expected by 'extract_answer'.

This is neutral and does not guide the LLM toward understanding why the question might be implausible given Mookie Betts' actual sporting background.
